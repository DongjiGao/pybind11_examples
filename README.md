# pybind11_examples

From the [`pybind11` readme](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11):

>   `pybind11` is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++ code. Its goals and syntax are similar to the excellent `Boost.Python` library by David Abrahams ...
>
>   The main issue with `Boost.Python` - and the reason for creating such a similar project â€” is `Boost`. `Boost` is an enormously large and complex suite of utility libraries that works with almost every C++ compiler in existence. ... Now that C++11-compatible compilers are widely available, this heavy machinery has become an excessively large and unnecessary dependency.

This repository contains several examples for the usage of `pybind11`. Even though the [online documentation](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io) provided by the developers of `pybind11` makes the usage of it relatively straightforward, several examples - such as provided here - make `pybind11` even easier to use. These example are meant for you to start quicker with `pybind11`. They are however by no means exhaustive, and do not always provide the optimal choice. Therefore it is highly advisable to 'think for yourself'. Furthermore, contributions with similar simple examples are highly welcomed.

To give credit where credit is due:

*   The creators of [`pybind11`](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) have done a great job! It is really easy to use, and very lightweight. Also the [documentation](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io) is already quite complete.

*   The examples made available by [Cliburn Chan and Janice McCarthy, at Duke University](http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663-2016/18G_C++_Python_pybind11.html) have been of enormous help. Please also read their [documentation](http://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663-2016/18G_C++_Python_pybind11.html).

>   Note that there are also test-cases included in the `pybind11` [repository](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11), but these are not very insightful when you are new to `pybind11`.

# Cloning this repository

The `pybind11` module (which is header only!) is included as a submodule of this repository. This asks for a little bit more attention when cloning this project. There are two options. The simplest one is

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tdegeus/pybind11_examples.git
```

This will download the submodule up to the version that is used in this project. To directly download the submodule from the source use


```bash
git clone https://github.com/tdegeus/pybind11_examples.git
cd pybind11_examples
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

# Dependencies

## Eigen

The [`Eigen`](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)-library is used in some of the `NumPy` examples. From these examples is can be observed that through `pybind11`, `Eigen` and `NumPy` are really handshake methods. Almost no code is needed to create the C++/Python interface.

[`Eigen`](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) doesn't need installation because it is also header-only. One just needs to download the files and include the headers at compile time.

*   For macOS with homebrew:

    ```bash
    brew install eigen
    ```

    then compile with

    ```bash
    -I /usr/local/Cellar/eigen/3.3.1/include/eigen3
    ```

    (or something similar specialized to your installation).

# CMake

## Basic usage

`pybind11` applications can be compiled very easy using `CMake`. If one adds `pybind11` as a sub-folder of the `src` directory. One can use for example the following `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```bash
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.12)
project(example)

add_subdirectory(pybind11)
pybind11_add_module(example example.cpp)
```

To make, use

```bash
cmake .
make
```

## Using `Eigen`

When `Eigen` is installed it can be easily included using:

```bash
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.12)
project(example)

find_package( PkgConfig )
pkg_check_modules( EIGEN3 REQUIRED eigen3 )
include_directories( ${EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIRS} )

add_subdirectory(pybind11)
pybind11_add_module(example example.cpp)
```
